DIS2017 WG5 summary
===================

This is the LaTeX source for a talk I gave at the ["25th International Workshop 
on Deep Inelastic Scattering and Related 
Topics"](https://indico.cern.ch/event/568360/), summarising the contributions 
made in the 'working group 5' parallel track on physics with heavy flavours.
The talk was given on behalf of Rhorry Gauld, Andrea Giammanco, and myself, as 
conveners of the WG5 sessions.

The PDF is available on the corresponding [DIS2017 agenda 
page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/568360/contributions/2390771/).
